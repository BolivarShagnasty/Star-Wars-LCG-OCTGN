=====Message of the Day======

New Alliances now available. Scripting for the set includes:
-Missions, when deployed, automatically transfer control to the opposing player and go to their side of the table
-Missions can be engaged, and when thwarted properly go to victory pile of correct player and increase dial
-Missions can be discarded from hand without issues
-Missions can be used in edge and go to discard correctly

Current known issues:
-Capturing at missions not currently working
-Missions do not pause for reactions upon leaving play, must be done manually

New Alliances cards with untested scripting:
Luke's Speeder Bike
Force Persuasion
Tydirium
Stolen Speeder Bike
Stolen AT-ST
Hiding Among Enemies
Courage of the Tribe
Chief Chirpa (technically triggers off phase end, but each phase ending is a phase beginning, so 6 one way, half dozen the other)
Ewok Horde
Battle of Endor (should be prompted for value)
Merciless Plans (should give react prompt, balance change must be done manually)
Boc (should get extra BD when attacking mission, no Targeted Strike yet)
Expendale Scout (Using ability causes sacrificing self, discard and draw must be done manually)
Sith Lightsaber (should work fine, not really different from other sabers)
Stalker (just shielding, not extra icons yet)
Sector Garrison
Moruth Doole


Further improvements will be added to mission functionality as they are successfully tested.

Scripting of other New Alliances cards and previously unscripted cards will be ongoing.
