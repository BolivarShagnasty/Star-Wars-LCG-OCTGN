=====Message of the Day======

--- IMPORTANT NOTE ---
Please do not discard cards by dragging them manually to the discard pile. 
Rather user the "Discard Card/Thwart Objective" (shortcut is the key "del") function

Doing so will trigger all the relevant scripts for this and any other card on the table (for example Leia's ability)
It will also discard any attachments of the card and clear all necessary variables.

Discarding cards manually is going to leave those variables unset, which will lead to game errors.
