=====Message of the Day======

Draw Their Fire now available

Set added by BolivarShagnasty; any cards that are reprints from previous sets are scripted. Pilots should be able to be deployed on vehicles.
The Survivors, Qu Rahn, Advanced Proton Torpedoes, LE-B02D9, Outrider, Advanced Concussion Missiles, Hand of the Emperor, and DS-61-3 have automations,
though testing has been extremely limited. Please report any issues to:
https://github.com/BolivarShagnasty/Star-Wars-LCG-OCTGN/issues


--- Important ---
I don't have the time to properly maintain the SW LCG anymore. If anyone has any experience in Python and would like to take over development, please contact me.
