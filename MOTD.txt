Darkness and Light now Available

Large batch of Echoes cycle script added by BolivarShagnasty; roughly half have been tested. Take special note of the following:

All Echoes of the Force should now work
All Seeds of Decay should now work
All Force Struggle Resources should work
Believer Initiate is not a constant effect, only on Force Struggle resolve
Hate works, but token it places to cancel text must be manually removed if Hate is moved
Salacious Crumb only works for 1 Focus on any Character; if Jabba you need to manually remove the second Focus
