=====Message of the Day======

Solo's Command now available. Scripting for the set includes:
-Missions, when deployed, automatically transfer control to the opposing player and go to their side of the table
-Missions can be engaged, and when thwarted properly go to victory pile of correct player and increase dial
-Missions can be discarded from hand without issues
-Missions can be used in edge and go to discard correctly

Known issues:
-Capturing at missions not currently working
-Missions do not pause for reactions upon leaving play, must be done manually

For non-mission cards:
-Shield Generator Assault, Wicket, Part of the Tribe, IG-88B, Illegal Modifications, Filthy Accusations have untested scripts
-None of the other cards have properly tested scripting, all game text must be executed manually

Further improvements will be added to mission functionality as they are successfully tested.

Scripting of other Solo's Command cards and previously unscripted cards will be ongoing.
