=====Message of the Day======

IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ.

There's a new bug in OCTGN that is bringing player decks in an out-of-sync state after shuffling.

This means that any of your cards which attempts to grab information from opponent's decks or discard piles might be wrong.
This will primarily affect cards with effects like "Take them Prisoner" and not even doing it manually will avoid it.

Please avoiding playing decks with suchs cards until further notice.

There is nothing I can do about this at the moment as it's a serious OCTGN bug.

I've informed the developers and will inform you on the blog and the MOTD when there's any news.
