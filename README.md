Changelog
---------

### 1.0.1

* Finishing the engagement now clears the opponent's edge cards as well
* Tactic:1 strikes now focus the target unit
* Spread out the objectives a bit
* Free units/enhancements now are autoplaced.
* Can now manually shuffle the objective deck

### 1.0.0

First working version for the public. It has basic gameplay functionality but not card scripting (i.e. individual card effects are not automated)

However the basic things you need to do quickly and effortlessly should be possible.
