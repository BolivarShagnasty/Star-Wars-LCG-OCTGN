1.1.2||
======New Version Information======

The Desolation of Hoth has begun!

The new set is now available in OCTGN and it includes automation for almost all cards. 

Card like Lord Vader's Command, Hoth Operations and Wilderness Fighters will work their extra effects automatically so as to prevent any mistakes and you can concentrate on playing the game

Due to the significant work required to make the new automations work, you'll need to upgrade your game definition to 1.1.0 in order to install The Desolation of Hoth.
You do not need to uninstall your previous definition to do that, but once you do, make sure you install the new markers file and patch your core set to 1.1.0


Enjoy!
