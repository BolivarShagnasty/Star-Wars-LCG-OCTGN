1.0.10||
======New Version Information======

New version finally brings card automations to Star Wars: The Card Game on OCTGN!

This means that your game is going to flow faster than ever, as you have less to mess with the game engine, and more time to focus on the actual decisions of the game.

Most card will take their abilities as soon as they come into play, or as soon as their trigger is called
For example cards which do something after refreshing, will do it automatically. 
If there's only one possible target for their effect, they will use that, but if there's more than one, you'll get the option to select one of them.

Many abilities will work without significant input from the player. 
In case an effect requires a target, remember to do it before activating the effect. You can target by shift+clicking on a card.

Events will take effect just after you pay for them. 
So don't rush them and allow your opponent a chance to play interrupts before you pay them.

There's also some changes in the way you setup. Now starting objectives are placed face down. 
Once both players are ready and have mulliganed if needed, simply double-click on one of them to turn them face-up and trigger their effects.

Enjoy!

IMPORTANT: Please update your markers to v.1.0.2
