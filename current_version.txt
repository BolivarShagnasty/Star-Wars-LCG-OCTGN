======New Version Information======

New version improves engagement by separating it into steps (i.e. phases) as well. 
This means that you can easily communicate who's turn it is to declare participants or when you're ready to start playing edge cards and so on.

The steps work as always, once you're in an engagement, simple press Ctrl+Enter to move to the next step.
The game is also smart enough to auto-announce a phase when you take an action that belongs to it
(For example if you play an edge card, the game will announce the "Edge Battle" step). 

This also includes some extra automation to make things faster and more robust. Reaching the "Reward Unopposed" step will automatically end the engagement, and reaching the strikes step will make sure the edge battle is resolved.

Other than that, there's a bunch of important bug fixes and all around improvement. 

Enjoy!
